## Phoenix Project

---

-   [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=dennyzhang-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=71878608a6bfd8fe98ca2cc56a10031a&creativeASIN=0988262509): An interesting novel. I love it! Quite easy to read and very amusing.

And it helps to answer one common question: What is DevOps? How does it look like?  

One big problem for reading is it's super hard to start. This novel makes it easier. Try it.
